# Central Valley Enhanced Acoustic Tagging Project

## Background
Since 2012, juvenile salmon have been tagged and tracked throughout California's Central Valley (CCV) using Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS) technology. This technology allows researchers to monitor the movement and survival rates of various populations over 500 river kilometers, from Redding to the Pacific Ocean. The data compiled here is a result of the hard work and coordination between various federal and state agencies, universities, and private consultants, with the goal of conserving and restoring California's once abundant, but now imperiled, Chinook salmon populations. This data is open access and is managed and hosted by the National Marine Fisheries Service here: https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/FED_JSATS_detects.html.

## Receiver Deployments
An interactive map of acoustic receivers (JSATS, Vemco, Real-time) deployed throughout the CCV by water year, which is defined as the 12 month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following calendar year (i.e. water year 2017 spans 10/1/17-9/30/18). The deployment period of individual receivers is displayed in a table below the map, once a general location is clicked. This map is useful to identify a particular site of interest, and to see when coverage existed in that area and which receiver(s) potentially recorded migrating fish.

## Hydrology
The hydrology of the Sacramento River is highly variable, and is largely driven by storm events and associated runoff in the winter, followed by dam controlled releases for agricultural purposes in the summer. These interactive graphs of Sacramento (SR) and San Joaquin River (SJR) flows (cubic feet per second) at four different CDEC (California Data Exchange Center) stations on each river: KES (Keswick Reservoir, SR), BND (Bend Bridge, SR), BTC (Butte City, SR), WLK (Wilkins Slough, SR), MEN (Mendota, SJR), NEW (Newman, SJR), VNS (Vernalis, SJR), and MSD (Mossdale Bridge, SJR) displays the annual and inter-annual variation in flows from upstream to downstream gauging stations. In addition, the temperatures at KES, BND, WLK, and MSD are shown. These plots were created using the R package dygraphs.

## Outmigration animation
The Outmigration Animation tab visualizes fish outmigration using detection data over time. Unique fish detections at each receiver location are plotted by day, and numbers of unique detections per receiver are overlaid in each point. This animation helps to visualize the movement of fish across a broad geographic landscape, and demonstrates the differences in outmigration timing across space and time among specific populations. This animation was created using the R packages leaflet and leaflet.extras.
